<div class="essQ"><p><b>How do I even start coding with python?</b></p>
<p> You can start by first downloading Sublime. It's a free coding software. Make sure you have some sort of terminal on your computer. Most computers, if not all, come with one already. Then you can look down the page a little bit for instructions.

</div>
<div class="extMedia"><p><b>External Media</b></p></div>
<div class="bhl"><p><b>Sublime Text</b></p>
<p>For these lessons, we will be using Sublime text, a program for coding. 
You can find it <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">here.</a>

<p><b>Starting your program</b></p>
<p>Before you do anything, the first thing you need to do it save. You can do this by going into the top left corner of the screen (on a mac) and clicking <b>file</b> then <b>New File.</b> Then, go to <b>file</b> again, and click <b>save</b> or <b>save as. Alternatively, you can just press command+s.</b>  When you choose the name of the file, <b>add .py to the end of it</b>, and don’t add any spaces. You can name it whatever you want, but I am naming it CSXWebPython.py </p>




<p><b>Def main():</b></p>
<p>The first thing on any sublime python program is:</p>

<p>def main(): </p>

<p>if __name__ == '__main__':</p>
	<p>main()</p>

<p>You do not need to remember if__name(and so on), you can just type if under def main():, and it should come up in a little box like this:</p>		

<p>Just press enter. If the word if is grey, you probably did not save yet. </p>




<p><b>Saving</b></p>
<p>Press command+s to save. Saving is an important part of coding. It is so important, it gets a little text box. <b>Save whenever you can.</b> I can not stress this enough. </p>

<p>The small circle means that the program has <b>not</b> been saved. The little x means it is saved and ready to go!

<p><b>Print</b></p>
<p>First, go the the empty line under def main():. Press tab once. The tabbing means that it is under the def main():. You will learn much more about tabbing in if statements. Type print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; It should work like this. <b>Remember to save!</b></p>


<p><b>The Terminal</b></p>
<p>For this tutorial, I will be using the MacBook Pros default terminal. It comes with the laptop, and requires no download. You can find it in your programs. There are certain commands for using the terminal. You can use them by typing them in and pressing enter.</p>
<ul>

<li> LS: Show everything in the current location. It should list everything.</li>

<li> CD ___: Open the folder specified after CD. Ex: CD Documents
python  ____.py: Activates the python program specified in ____.</li>

</ul>
<p>Use these commands to navigate your computer until you find the program itself. Activate it, and it should print Hello, world! If it pops up with an error, or something else, check your code, or see if you saved.</p>

<p><b>Variables</b></p>
<p>Unlike other languages, pythons variables are a little funky. To create a variable, type x = &quot;X&quot;, then save. Congrats! You just made a string variable!</p>

<p>Now type print x into your code. Save again, and test it out in the terminal. It should print X.</p> 

<p>Variables in python are sort of like variables in math. Like, X = 23 in 2X + 3.</p> 

<p>Now lets try changing up that variable. After your current code, type
x = len(x) This will change the variable x to the number of characters in the variable x, so in this case, one. After saving, it should print</p>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>1</p>

<p><b>User input</b></p>
<p>Now that we know how to print, lets learn how to input things into the program! You can create a new file or use the same file, whichever you want.</p>
<p>First, make a new variable. For the sake of it, I will use userInput for my variable. Type userInput = raw_input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;) 
Remember to save, then on the next line down, type print userInput.
Save again, then test it out in terminal!
Now, you’ve made a digital parrot, good job, but we can do better! </p>

<p>Get rid of print userInput and instead type print userInput + &quot;, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Save, then test it out! Now, you’ve got a judgemental program, that is sort of making your fun of your name, but no too much. If you want, we can make it more polite!</p>

<p>Get rid of print userinput + &quot;,huh?&quot; then add</p>
<p>print &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; + userInput + &quot;!&quot; There, thats better!</p>

<p>This is called <b>concatenation</b>, adding strings and string variables together!</p></div>
