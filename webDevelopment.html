<div class="bhl"><p>Web developers can use a variety of programming languages to create their websites. However, HTML, Javascript, and CSS are the three programming languages that are most commonly used.</p><p>HTML is used to render information such as images, text, and links. CSS is then used for describing the makeup and format of a document written in HTML. Javascript is a programming language of HTML and is used for user interaction on a webpage.</p><p>One can also develop a website using drag and drop technology. These consist of Weebly, GoDaddy, Wix etc. This allows for less personalization, however, this is a good way to start basic web design.</p></div>
