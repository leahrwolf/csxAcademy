<h3> What is binary to decimal conversion and what is it used for?</h3>
<p> Conversion of binary to decimal (base-2 to base-10) numbers and back is an important concept to understand as the binary numbering system forms the basis for all computer and digital systems. The decimal or “denary” counting system uses the Base-of-10 numbering system where each digit in a number takes on one of ten possible values, called “digits”. The binary counting system uses the Base-of-2 numbering system where each digit in a number takes o one of two possible values, 0 or 1. Bianry is a very important concept in encryption and decryption, especially in private key encryption.</p>

>>>>>>> origin/master

<p>Step 1: Write down the binary number and list the powers of 2 from right to left. Let's say we want to convert the binary number 10011011(base2) to decimal. Write down the powers of two from right to left. Start at 2^0, evaluating it as "1". Increment the exponent by one for each power.The example number, 10011011, has eight digits, so the list, with eight elements, would look like this: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</p>
<p>Step 2: Write down the final value of each power of two. Move through each digit of the binary number. If the digit is a 1, write its corresponding power of two below the line, under the digit. If the digit is a 0, write a 0 below the line, under the digit. Since "1" corresponds with "1", it becomes a "1." Since "2" corresponds with "1," it becomes a "2." Since "4" corresponds with "0," it becomes "0." And so on.</p>
<p>Step 3: Add the final values. Now, add up the numbers written below the line. Here's what you do: 128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 155. This is the decimal equivalent of the binary number 10011011.</p>
