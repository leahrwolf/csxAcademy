A statement in Javascript is used as an instruction for the web browser. A variable in Javascript, similar to a variable in Python, is something that stores value of data. To create a variable you first type var, you then type your variable name, let us call it z, you than make something equal to the variable let us call it 75. This would be written as var z=75.</p><p><b>Final Message</b></p><p>In this section you have learned the basics of Javascript and how it relates to web development.
