<div class="essQ"><font color="purple"><p><b>Okay, I know how to use sublime and how to start a program.what now?</b></p></font>
<p>Now you can really begin to code! On this page, we'll be going over how to make basic programs such as a program that says hello back to you, covering all the information you need to make it!</p>
<p>Aaah! The robot uprising is neigh!</p>

<div class="extMedia"><font color="purple"><p><b>External Media</b></p></div></font>

<font color="purple"><p><b>Print</b></p></font>
<p>First, go the the empty line under def main():. Press tab once. The tabbing means that it is under the def main():. You will learn much more about tabbing in if statements. Type print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;It should work like this. <b>Remember to save!</b></p>
<p> Use your terminal navigation skills you learned in <a href="pythonStartingWith.html">Starting with Python</a> to start the program. It should say whatever you typed into the quotes!</p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>Variables</b></p></font>
<p>Unlike other languages, pythons variables are a little funky. To create a variable, type x = &quot;X&quot;, then save. Congrats! You just made a string variable!</p>

<p>Now type print x into your code. Save again, and test it out in the terminal. It should print X.</p> 

<p>Variables in python are sort of like variables in math. Like, X = 23 in 2X + 3.</p> 

<p>Now lets try changing up that variable. After your current code, type
x = len(x) This will change the variable x to the number of characters in the variable x, so in this case, one. After saving, it should print</p>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>1</p>


<font color="purple"><p><b>User input</b></p></font>
<p>Now that we know how to print, lets learn how to input things into the program! You can create a new file or use the same file, whichever you want.</p>
<p>First, make a new variable. For the sake of it, I will use userInput for my variable. Type userInput = raw_input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;) 
Remember to save, then on the next line down, type print userInput.
Save again, then test it out in terminal!
Now, youve made a digital parrot, good job, but we can do better! </p>

<p>Get rid of print userInput and instead type print userInput + &quot;, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Save, then test it out! Now, youâ€™ve got a judgemental program, that is sort of making your fun of your name, but no too much. If you want, we can make it more polite!</p>

<p>Get rid of print userinput + &quot;,huh?&quot; then add</p>
<p>print &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; + userInput + &quot;!&quot; There, thats better!</p>

<p>Save, then test it out! Now, you have got a judgemental program, that is sort of making your fun of your name, but no too much. If you want, we can make it more polite!</p>

<p>Get rid of print userinput + &quot;,huh?&quot; then add</p>
<p>print &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; + userInput + &quot;!&quot; There, thats better!</p>


<p>This is called <b>concatenation</b>, adding strings and string variables together!</p></div>
