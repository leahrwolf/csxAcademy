<p>Computer science is the study of the simple uses of computers and how they are used. The major topics include Game Theory, which helps with problem solving and decision making, Encryption and Decryption, which helps us to understand how information can be shared in a private way by altering thetext, Web Development, which allows us to share information through the Internet using codes like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, Artifical Intelligence, which helps educate and build our lives, and Python, which is considered to be the easiest form of code. There are any more branches of computer science, however, these 5 will be the main topics of this website.</p>

<p><h4><font color= "green">Python:</font></h4></p> 
<p>Python is one of the simpliest forms of code and one of the easiest to read. It contains clear syntaxes and has commands that are easy to read. In this section, you will learn the basics of Python including 'print' statements, 'if' statements, 'for' loops, and much more. </p>

<p><h4><font color= "green">Game Theory:</font></h4></p>
<p>Game Theory deals with problem solving and possible outcomes. In this section of CSX Academy, you will cover topics just as The Prisoner's Dilemma, P=NP, Pay Off Matricies, and Nash Equilibrium. </p>

<p><h4><font color= "green">Encryption and Decryption:</font></h4></p>
<p>Encryption is the process of taking plain text, or regular characters, and changing them into chipher text, or text that can not be easily understood. Decrytption is the process of taking cipher text and changing it back into plain text. While in this lesson, you will learn about basic ciphers, public and private key, and binary and decimal numbers.</p>

<p><h4><font color= "green">Web Development:</font></h4></p>
<p>Web Development is the development of a website on the World Wide Web. This section will cover topics such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and give you an insight on how to build a website.</p>

<p><h4><font color= "green">Artificial Intelligence:</font></h4></p>

>>>>>>> origin/master
<p>Artificail Intelligence (also called AI) is intelligence that is displayed by a certain software or computer. One simple example is Siri on Apple's Iphone. Today artifical intelligence is development at a rapid rate. In this section you will explore hoe artificial intelligence is programmed and how we can use it in our everyday life.</p>
