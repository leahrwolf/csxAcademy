<div class="essQ">What is the Nash Equilibrium?
<p> Nash Equilibrium is a game's prefered outcome when no player has desire to change their chosen strategy after the opponent's moves. </p></div>

<p> Named after the great Game Theorist, John Forbes Nash Juniour. Nash equilibria must exist for all finite games with any number of players. If each player in a finite game has a strategy and cannot benefit by changing their strategy while they see their opponent or opponent's strategy, then the payoffs constitute a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p> In other words, CC and Sarthak are in nash equilibrium and if CC makes his most dominant descision, taking into account of Sarthak's descision and Sarthak makes his most domimnt strategy, taking into account of CC's descision but both descsions are unchanged. So both players choose their optimal startegies taking into account of the other individual's descision, given the descision has been unchanged.</p>
<p> One common example is rock paper scissors! How do you think this relates to Nash Equilibrium and how would an individual play the game in nash equilibrium. Tell us what you think and go to the rock paper scissors page to find out how such a simple game, rock paper scissors, involves game theory!</p></div>
