<p>The Prisoners Dilemma is a very common problem in Game Theory that deals with two participants, lets call them CC and Sarthak since you're already familiar with them. CC and Sarthak have both committed a crime lets call it larceny. However, they are apart of a larger crime, lets call it fraud. They can either remain silent about their larger crime or they can confess about their larger crime. They both are interrogated separately  therefore, they can't know each other's strategy.</p>
<p>The options for the players are both CC and Sarthdak can stay silent, both CC and Sarthak can confess, CC can confess while Sarthhak stays silent, and Sarthak could confess while CC stay silent</p>
<p>Both CC and Sarthak stay silent: both recieve 1 year of prison</p><p> Only CC confesses while Sarthak stays silent: CC is set free while Sarthak recieves 20 years of prison</p>
<p>Only Sarthak confesses while CC stays silent: Sarthak is set free while CC recieves 20 years of prison</p> 
<p>Their optimal strategy would confessing since it would for both of their best interests.</p>
