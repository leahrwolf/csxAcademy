<p>P=NP is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks if all problems whose solution could be quickly found by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.  </p></div>

<p>P versus NP is a major unsolved problem in computer science that asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved a computer. It was first mentioned by Kurt Gobel, the man on the left, who believed he had solved the problem. However, unfortunately he was not correct.</p> 

 <p>A correct solution of P versus NP would result in  $1,000,000 cash prize. Today, P versus NP remains one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems that were deemed unsolvable. Don't worry if you don't fully understand P versus NP, it is a problem that still alludes mathematicians.</p>
