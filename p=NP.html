<div class="essQ"><h3><font color="purple">What is P=NP?</font></h3>
<p>P=NP is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks if all problems whose solution could be quickly found by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.  </p></div>

<font color="purple"><p><h3>So what is P versus NP?</h3></p></font>
<p> While P versus NP is a major unsolved problem in computer science that asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved a computer. It was first mentioned by Kurt Gobel, the man on the left, who believed he had solved the problem. However, unfortunately he was not correct.</p> 
 <p>A correct solution of P versus NO would result in  $1,000,000 cash prize. Today, P versus NP remains one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems that were deemed unsolvable. Don't worry if you don't fully understand P versus NP, it is a problem that still alludes mathematicians.</p>
