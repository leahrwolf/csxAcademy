<h2 class="subtitle">HTML</h2>
<div class="menu" id="webdevhtml">

<div class="essQ"><font color="purple"><b>How do I start using HTML?</b></font>
<p>You can start by downloading <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">sublime,</a> a program that allows you to write many different programs. If you've seen the python page, you'll reconize this program. So, if you already have it, you don't need to download it again! I won't be covering how to use the basic functions of sublime in this section, see <a href="pythonStartingWith.html">Starting with Python,</a> for that.</div>

</div>

<div class="bhl"><font color="purple"><p><b>Creating the file</b></p></font>
<p>Whenever you start a new Html program in sublime, you will first need to make a file, and save it as whatever you want to call it .html.</p>
<p>Exsample: programname.html</p> 

<font color="purple"><p><b>The format</b></p></font>
<p> Every html program on sublime starts with the same specific format. </p>
<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>	
<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>No terminal</b></p></font>
<p>Unlike python, Html does not open program through the terminal, reather through your web broweser. But don't worry! Just beacause you make an html file, doesn't mean it's on the internet now for everyone to see! It's just a file, and you will need a bit more to get it online. Now that you have the format down, go into your files and select the html file you are working on. It should pop up in your browser. If you want to open a file in sublime, right click (or do an alternate form of right clicking) and select Open with. Sublime should be one of the options.
</p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>The head</b></p></font>
<p> The first bit we need to look at is the head. One of the things you can do there is change the little tab at the top of your browser's name. Press enter from the first bit of the head, then tab in.</p>
<p> Type &lt;title&gt;My Webpage&lt;/title&gt; </p>
<p>It should look like this.</p>
<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>
<p>*tab in css*&lt;title&gt;My Webpage&lt;/title&gt; </p>
<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>You can change &quot;My Webpage&quot; to anything you want, really. There are many more things you can do with the head, but we won't be covering them right now.</p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>The Body</b></p></font>
<p>Now that we have the head, all we need is the body. Usally, the body has more code in it. </p>
<p>You can tab and enter your way inbetween &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;, like you did in the head. </p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>Headings</b></p></font>
<p>Let's start off by creating a heading. Type this:</p>
<p>&lt;h4&gt;My Webpage&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>h4 is the heading we are using. h3, h2, and other numbers are differnt heading sizes. Feel free to mess around with it, and as always, you can change the heading to whatever you want.</p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>Paragraphs and Normal text</b></p></font>
<p> Like what I just did, you can add paragraphs, or spaces in your text by simply adding a &lt;p&gt; at the start,  and a &lt;/p&gt; at the end. You'll end up with spaces in the text,</p>
<p> Like this! </p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>Ordered and Unordered lists</b></p></font>
<p> In html, you can create lists of things. There are two types of ways to do this. Ordered and unordered lists.</p>
<p> Ordered lists list whatever you want in numbers, starting with one and moving down the list. Unordered lists are just bullet points.</p>
<p> To make an unordered list, first type &lt;ul&gt; then press enter, then type &lt;/ul&gt;. Go back up to &lt;ul&gt; and press enter. </p>
<p> Now, add &lt;li&gt;Cats&lt;/li&gt; </p>
<p> You can press enter again, and type &lt;li&gt;Dogs&lt;/li&gt; </p>
<p> You can keep doing this for as long as you want, with whatever you want. </p>
<p> An ordered list is the same thing you just did, but with &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;/ol&gt; instead of &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; </p>

<font color="purple"><p><b>Links</b></p></font>
<p>You can set up links to websites or other html files on your computer, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">like here.</a> Just type</p>
<p>&lt;a href-"http://www.wikipedia.org" target=&quot;_blank&gt;Look at my link!&lt;a&gt;</p>
<p>The link can be anything you want it to be.</p>
