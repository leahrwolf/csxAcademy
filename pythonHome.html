<div class="essQ"><b><p> What is Python?</p></b>

<div class="bhl"><b><p> How can it be used?</p></b>
<p>Python can be used to make small, text based adventure games in the terminal of your computer, to making large, complex animations in Blender (A 3D animation program).</p> 

<b><p> Python Vs. Other Coding languages</p></b>
<p>Python is very different from other popular coding languages. This does not mean it is a huge hassle to learn another once you have learned python, though. Python is much simpler than the larger, more complex programs. It is a good launchpad into the world of coding.</p>
