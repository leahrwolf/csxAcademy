<p>A payoff matrix is the outcome of a game of different strategies shown in a table. The simplest pay off matrices occur when there are only two players who can only follow two strategies. </p></div>

<p>Pay-off Matrix: The outcome of a game of different strategies shown in a table.</p>

<p>A payoff matrix is the outcome of a game of different strategies shown in a table. The simplest pay off matrices occur when there are only two players who can only follow two strategies. </p>

<p> The picture of the left shows a great real life example where two rational thinking sides can etither choose to back down or hold ground for their respective sides. Either side does not know what the other side is going to do. If both USA and USSR back down, no damage is done and the payoff is 0,0. If the USA backs down and the USSR holds ground then the payoff is 50,-50 in favor of the USSR and if the USA holds ground while the USSR backs down, then the payoff is 50,-50 in favor of the USA. Lastly, the two options left are they both can hold ground and there is lots of damage and the payoff is -100,-100.</p>
<p> This explains a lot about payoff matricies but feel free to watch the video to get more knowlege about this fascinating topic.3</div>

<p><font color="purple">The Rock, Paper, Scissors Program:</font> As you can see on the left with are Rock, Paper, Scissors program, Game Theory can easily be related to computer science. However, how does Rock, Paper, Scissors relate to Game Theory and Payoff Matrices? Well Rock, Paper, Scissors is a common game that deals with two participants who have 3 choices. If player A choses Rock while Player B also choses Rock it is a draw, which constitutes a payoff of 0 for each player. If player A choses Paper while player B chosess Paper it is also a draw, which constitutes a payoff of 0 for each player. If player A choses Scissors while player B choses Scissors it is also a draw, which constitutes a payoff of 0 for each player. If player A choses Rock while player B choses Paper, player B wins, which constitutes a payoff of 1 for player B and a payoff of -1 for player A. If player A choses Rock while player B choses Rock, player A wins, which constitutes a payoff of 1 for player A and a payoff of -1 for player B. If player A choses Paper while player B choses Rock, player A wins, which constitutes a payoff of 1 for player A and a payoff of -1 for player B. If player A choses Paper while player B choses Scissors, player B wins, which constitutes a payoff of 1 for player B and a payoff of -1 for player A. If player A choses Scissors while player B choses Rock, player B wins, which constitutes a payoff of 1 for player B and a payoff of -1 for player A. If player A choses Scissors while player B choses Paper, player A wins, which constitutes a payoff of 1 for player A and a payoff of -1 for player B.
